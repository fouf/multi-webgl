# multi-webgl
A multi-user environment leveraging the power of socket.io &amp; webgl. A work in progress.

Uses [Phaser](https://phaser.io) for client-side rendering and [Socket.io](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io) for communication. Currently the client side does little work and receive lots of updates from the server. Future versions will give more work to the client and interpolate less frequent updates from the server.
